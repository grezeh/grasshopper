Plan 225: Grasshopper.

A fen-shui place for all the homeless 2.25u novelties, that i have. Top slot is for grass by default (or plant your tomatoes/make a zen sand garden/put aquarium/terrarium/what have you). Bottom ala-MX switch and "plate" stabilizer snap in from the top (case is 1-piece). Probably need 8mm "3m" bumpons (4 pcs) or use without. Assumed mjf print. No guarantees, use at own discretion. Oh, it is wireless too (no pcb=no wires=good travel board).

Grasshopper 2: enlargened keycap windows closer to standard size (easier to change caps); stab cutout mod
Touch grass, keep cooking.
